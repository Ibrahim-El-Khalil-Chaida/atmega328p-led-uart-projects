# Embedded Systems Projects â€“ ATMega328P + Gertboard

This repository contains my practical lab projects using the ATMega328P microcontroller on the Gertboard platform, written in C and compiled using avr-gcc. Programs are uploaded using avrdude and tested via UART (minicom).

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- [Task 1.5](./task_1_5): LED sequence animation using PORTB and PORTD
- [Task 1.7](./task_1_7): UART-controlled LED speed with serial feedback

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- avr-gcc
- avr-objcopy
- avrdude
- minicom
- Makefiles

## ðŸ’¡ Upcoming Tasks
Task 1.8 and beyond will be added as I progress.
